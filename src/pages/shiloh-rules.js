            Two Union nurses and two female Confederate refugees struggle to hold their ground at Shiloh National Military Park in a reenactment of 1868â€™s bloodiest Civil War battle. Opposing them all is Ranger Wilson, a Black woman park ranger who wants nothing to do with 1868. As things slip out of control, a supply and refreshment stand operator convinces her the only way to restore order is to go onto the field in a Union uniform. None of them comes out unwounded or unchanged - except for the Widow Beckwith and her supply cart, moving on to the next war game. A dark comedy with serious intent.

            <p className="play-meta mt-3"><strong>Press:</strong> <i>It's not easy finding a new take on something as heavily scrutinized as the Civil War, but Doris Baizley has done it in "Shiloh Rules," an inventive comedy with some drama, history and first-aid tips thrown in. Sterling performances by the six-member, all-female cast make the production, by the Flying Fig Theater and Middle Tennessee State University, a rewarding trip back to, well, the present.
